# IDA Decomp Psudocode - 'xboxkrnl.exe' version 5933

### NOTES

- Used the available `xboxkrnl.exe + xboxkrnl.pdb` version 5933, Google will help you find these
- This is MAINLY FOR MY OWN LEARNING, Most likely useless to most people
- This is just 'psudocode' from Hex-Rays Decompiler outputted as-is.
- Every 'function' in IDA I could view Psudocode to was made into a .c file
- The Dissassembled code from IDA is in the .asm files



As I said, This is for my own learning, just testing what IDA can do and to compare with what I have..

Do as you please with this generated code :)
